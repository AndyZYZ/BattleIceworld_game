###BattleIceworld

This is a small fps game that I created to learn Unity3d.  

I use an FPS add on called UFPS to constuct the basic strcture of the game.

It can provide a basic game experience now.

It still has some bugs like AI firing through walls.

I will continue update the game when I've learned somethning new about Unity3d.

Hope you guys will enjoy it.
